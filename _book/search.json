    "text": "4.5 Variables versus Objects\nIn Python, variables and the objects they point to actually live in two different places in the computer memory. Think of variables as pointers to the objects they’re associated with, rather than being those objects. This matters when multiple variables point to the same object.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3]  # create a list; x points to the list\ny = x          # y also points to the same list in the memory\ny.append(4)    # append to y\nx              # x changed!\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n\nNow check their addresses\n\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n\n140607470231808\n140607470231808\n\n\nNonetheless, some data types in Python are “immutable”, meaning that their values cannot be changed in place. One such example is strings.\n\nx = \"abc\"\ny = x\ny = \"xyz\"\nx\n\n'abc'\n\n\nNow check their addresses\n\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n\n140607357509552\n140607436093296\n\n\nQuestion: What’s mutable and what’s immutable?\nAnything that is a collection of other objects is mutable, except tuples.\nNot all manipulations of mutable objects change the object rather than create a new object. Sometimes when you do something to a mutable object, you get back a new object. Manipulations that change an existing object, rather than create a new one, are referred to as “in-place mutations” or just “mutations.” So:\n\nAll manipulations of immutable types create new objects.\nSome manipulations of mutable types create new objects.\n\nDifferent variables may all be pointing at the same object is preserved through function calls (a behavior known as “pass by object-reference”). So if you pass a list to a function, and that function manipulates that list using an in-place mutation, that change will affect any variable that was pointing to that same object outside the function.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = x\n\ndef append_42(input_list):\n    input_list.append(42)\n    return input_list\n\nappend_42(x)\n\n[1, 2, 3, 42]\n\n\nNote that both x and y have been appended by \\(42\\)."
